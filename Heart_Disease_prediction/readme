# CardioCareML

This is a complete Machine Learning project to predict heart disease risk using patient health data. The project covers end-to-end workflow including data exploration, preprocessing, model training & evaluation.

## Workflow

1. Data Loading & Cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Outlier Detection & Removal
4. Preprocessing & Feature Scaling
5. Model Building - Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree
6. Model Evaluation 
7. Conclusion

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Dataset
Public heart disease dataset containing patient vitals and clinical data like age, cholesterol, blood pressure, and ECG results.
